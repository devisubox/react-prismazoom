# react-prismazoom

## About

A pan and zoom component for React, using CSS transformations.

Depends only upon prop-types, react and react-dom modules.  
Works on both desktop and mobile.

Online demo [here!](https://sylvaindubus.github.io/react-prismazoom/)

### Zoom features :mag_right:
* Zoom with the mouse-wheel or a two-finger pinch
* Zoom using double-click or double-tap
* Zoom on selected area and center

### Pan features :point_up_2:
* Pan with the mouse pointer or with one finger when zoomed-in
* Intuitive panning depending on available space when zoomed-in
* Adjusts cursor style to indicate in which direction the element can be moved

## Contribution

If you want to contribute, feel free to send a merge request or open a discussion. Currently, I just have time to maintain the package, but not enough to make big changes or add important features.

All contribution would be quite appreciated! üòâ

Among changes I would like to apply:
- Migrate to TypeScript
- Transform to a functional component (that could help splitting the code)
- Make motion logic less dependant to React
- Replace Enzyme with another testing library

## Breaking changes on v3

* The `locked` prop has been replaced by `allowZoom` and `allowPan` to handle zooming and panning events separately

## Breaking changes on v2

* The package now requires React v16.3 or higher (in order to use react references)
* The zoom feature through gestures or mousewheel got some improvements to react better with all devices. You may need to adjust the `scrollVelocity` property passed to the component in order to keep the same effect.


## Installation

### Install the component

```bash
$ npm i -D react-prismazoom
```

### Install the demo

This project includes a full-featured application demo.

First clone the project.

Go to the subfolder:
```bash
$ cd demo
```

Then, install it:

```bash
$ npm ci
```

Run the Webpack Dev Server:

```bash
$ npm start
```

### Run unit tests

‚ö†Ô∏è There is no unit tests anymore, since the previously used library is deprecated and doesn't support React 18. The current test suite need to be adapted using a different library.

## Usage

### Implementation

```jsx
import PrismaZoom from 'react-prismazoom'

<PrismaZoom>
  <img src="my-image.png" />
  <p>A text that can be zoomed and dragged</p>
</PrismaZoom>
```
